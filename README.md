Bunch of cool animations made with  Javis.jl

## 1. Earth-Venus Cosmic Dance
If the planets Earth and Venus are joined and the lines are plotted. They overlap to form to make this very mesmerizing five petal figure. 

## 2. Making a parabola with straight lines
Parabola is a simple curve which can be approximated by a bunch of straight lines drawn in a specific fashion. This animation is just that!

## 3. Pendulum: heavily damped, lightly damped and non damped
This is an animation of how dampinng affects the motion of the pendulum. The relevant physics is explained very vell in [this article](https://courses.lumenlearning.com/suny-osuniversityphysics/chapter/15-5-damped-oscillations/). There are three animations in this:
- Heavily damped: In this case the amplitude dies of very fast
- Lightly damped: In this case, the amplitude dies off very slowly.
- No damping: In this case the amplitude does not change at all.
